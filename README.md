The Navigation bar appears at the top of all three pages, maintaining a consistant look across the website. 
Within, users will find links to a relavant area of interest i.e Services or Social Spins. The company name 
appears in the left of the Navigation bar which will direct the user back to the homepage if clicked. Each 
item in the Navigation bar will appear highlighted when on that particular page, to aid navigation.

The first feature that will be apparant to users is the hero image displayed on the homepage coupled with a
